<h1>Hello Guys</h1>
<h2>Nipun </h2>
<h4> About me</h4>
<p> Student from Matrusri Engineering college</p>
<p> My research spans mobile systems, health IoT, and wireless networks. I develop new technologies, algorithms, and systems that enable smart homes, provide non-invasive health monitoring, improve WiFi and cellular performance, and deliver new applications that are not feasible given today's techonolgies. I draw on advanced mathematical models to deliver practical solutions, and combine novel sensing technologies with machine learning, optimization theory, and signal processing algorithms to solve real-world problems. </p>
